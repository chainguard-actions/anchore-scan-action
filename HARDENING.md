## Findings Fixed

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The workflow uses a mutable branch ref (@main) instead of a pinned full SHA commit hash. This means the referenced workflow could be changed at any time, enabling supply-chain attacks. Failing reference: `anchore/workflows/.github/workflows/oss-project-board-add.yaml@main`

Locations:

- `.github/workflows/oss-project-board-add.yaml:14`

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** unpinned-uses

**Notes:**

Pinned the mutable `@main` branch reference in `.github/workflows/oss-project-board-add.yaml` to the full commit SHA `48af2ac2ae466503efe50b585f3660dba2381bdd`, with a `# main` comment for readability. The workflow already had `permissions: {}` set, so no permissions changes were needed.
